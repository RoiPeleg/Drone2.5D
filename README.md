# slam-playground
Educational 2D SLAM implementation based on ICP and Pose Graph

![slamgui](https://github.com/Kolkir/slam-playground/blob/main/assets/slam.gif)

Our algorithm is based on the algorithm in the article "Vision-Less Sensing for Autonomous Micro-Drones".

We change the algorithm a bit and improved it.

Our simulator is based on an [open source simulator](https://github.com/Kolkir/slam-playground.git) with some improvements - Sensors, vectorial movement and more.

Our main movement algorithm can be found [here](https://github.com/RoiPeleg/Drone2.5D/blob/main/playground/Algorithms.py).

### How to use:

Run at the terminal the command: python simulation.py

To load specific map add to the command the road to the map file.
