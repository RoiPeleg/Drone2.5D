# slam-playground
Educational 2D SLAM implementation based on ICP and Pose Graph

![slamgui](https://github.com/Kolkir/slam-playground/blob/main/assets/slam.gif)

Our algorithm is based on the algorithm in the article "Vision-Less Sensing for Autonomous Micro-Drones".
We change the algorithm a bit and improved it.
Our main algorithm can be found here.

### How to use:

Run at the terminal the command: python simulation.py

To load specific map add to the command the road to the map file.
